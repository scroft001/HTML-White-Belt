# HTML-White-Belt
 All of the complete HTML white belt project for Hackingtons.com. Teacher resource

The goal of the white belt is to get the students coding and publishing a real website to the real internet. We use replit.com as our IDE and host.

This project should be completed in 1 class on the first day they attend.

Target ages: 9+ or 8+ if they have some coding experience.

HTML is great for beginner coders, artists, converting scratchers (have the scratch kids make a portfolio of their scratch games).

The topic can be chosen by the student and does not have to follow the video topic but does need to resemble the structure of the video.

Most students can skip the skills and just build the project.

# Common-problems:
    1) Nesting the body tag inside the head tag
    2) Spelling of image files is incorrect or missing .png or .jpg
    3) Choosing a topic is hard
